Introduction to Machine Learning
================================

Here are a bunch of implementations of different classical (i.e. non-deep) machine learning algorithms with R. Most of these have been written from scratch. For each of these we have written a short report on how they work and perform in different dataset. You'll find a per-built version of this report on my website: [Selected Topics in Machine Learning](https://eriksvjansson.net/papers/stiml.pdf). Feel free to use any source code as you please. The datasets however are not under the MIT license. I would not recommend using the script for anything serious though, as their performance can probably be improveda a lot. But for educational purposes, they are fine.
